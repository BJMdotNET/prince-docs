- [**"Prince Estate’s $31 Million Distribution Deal Is Rescinded"**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/business/media/prince-estate-distribution-deal-rescinded.html) By Ben Sisario - New York Times - July 13, 2017

   > Five months ago, the estate of Prince announced a major deal with the Universal Music Group for distribution rights for a substantial portion of the music star’s vast catalog. The largest of a series of multimillion-dollar contracts lined up in the months after Prince died, it was estimated at $31 million.
   >
   > But in a turn of events that has stunned the industry, the deal has now been rescinded by a judge, after Universal accused representatives of the estate of fraud and misrepresentation during negotiations and threatened a lawsuit if the company was not allowed to withdraw from the deal and get its money back.
