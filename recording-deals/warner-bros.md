    > After a few months, once the battle among record companies to get a record deal with him was finished, Prince got a hefty $80,000 advance payment from Warner Bros. Records, with an additional $250,000 if they renewed him after the first period (three albums in two years) and another $250,000 if they renewed for a second period (two albums in one year). These numbers might seem relatively small today, but in the late 70s, they were considered among the biggest record contracts for a new artist. Furthermore, Warners allowed him to spend $60,000 in each of his first three albums.
