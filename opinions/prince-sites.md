# Prince sites

Twenty-plus years ago, in the mid- to late-1990s, there was a burgeoning online Prince community, with plenty of talented people who all were trying to create an online presence for Prince in whatever fashion they felt was appropriate. That included humble old me, who back then was maintaining a GeoCities site that featured numerous pages containing various factoids, profiles, etc. (One of the most elaborate "articles" was a lengthy "investigation" into the origins of **The Time**'s ***Pandemonium***.) I was inspired by the likes of Warron Mason's The Vault and by a semi-official website about Sly Stone.

Imagine how different things could have been if Prince hadn't been such a hard-ass. Perhaps we could have had something like PrinceVault ages ago, except powered by custom software that would generate that sites' pages from the contents of a database. You would have been able to execute queries on that data, resulting in pages with charts depicting (for instance) the frequency of a certain song being played live. Or a chart depicting how Prince's playlists increasingly became those of a legacy band (concentrating on the hits with the odd new song thrown in vs. promoting the new material). We could show the productivity of certain periods.

Consider how outdated prince.org is: launched back then as a quick 'n' dirty replacement for the PPML. Yet all these decades later the site is still running (AFAIK) on a barely evolved version of an ancient bit of forum software that was (IIRC) customized. In some ways it is amazing that it is still running, yet at the same time I wonder how long that is going to last. In recent weeks embedding YouTube videos became broken, I assume caused by YouTube changing something. If the Org was running on modern forum software this would likely have not been an issue since such a change would likely have been supported by an update. The Org's WYSIWYG editor has always been a mess.

We could have had an online version of Uptown's work, except enhanced by updates. There could have been collaboration between sites via APIs or agreements, e.g. PrinceVault presenting a "just the facts, mam" view while linking to a different wiki where fans could collaborate on extensive concert reports. Or a "Prince news" website that would incorporate ideas from the likes of Reddit.
