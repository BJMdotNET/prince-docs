Dear Prince Estate,

I am only speaking for myself when I say: this isn't working. But I wouldn't be surprised if many fans agree.

*Welcome 2 America* was released on 30 July 2021. Since then your combined output has consisted of:

- "Do Me, Baby (Demo)": released digitally on 14 October 2021, with cassette copies arriving in February 2022 and vinyl 7" copies arriving (probably) in April 2022

- A number of reissues by Sony/Legacy (only in the USA) of Warner Bros. era albums (some of them long out of print, at least on vinyl)

- A Record Store Day release of a vinyl promo of *The Gold Experience*, with a CD reissue of the album coming later (only in the USA? or worldwide?).

And... that's it? That's all that you've managed in seven months.
And actually Record Store Day 2022 is still more than a month away, so that *TGE* promo isn't even out yet. 
Neither is the vinyl single of "Do Me, Baby (Demo)".
The CD reissue of *TGE* is scheduled for June (if the rumors/leaks are to be believed).

Actually, I'm lying. We also got store-exclusive "clear vinyl with white swirls" re-releases of *1999* and *Sign O' The Times*.
Two albums that got SDEs in -- let me check my notes -- 2019 and 2020 respectively.

We didn't get an SDE in 2021. 
It is clear you had planned for a *Diamonds & Pearls* SDE by November 2021; we've seen the remnants of the social media campaign appear around that date.
Its non-appearance is apparently to be blamed on delays during the development process of *Welcome 2 America*, but honestly I don't see what could have caused any delay.
Other than the widely reported worldwide vinyl pressing scarcity (which I'm guessing is also delaying that "Do Me, Baby (Demo)" 7").

Now, while I get that vinyl box sets results in huge profits, I don't see how delaying a release is earning you anything. 
So what if the vinyl set cannot be shipped at the same time as the CD version? Those who want it, will wait.
Yes, perhaps sales of the re-release of the regular LP will be lower, or perhaps sales of the "expanded" LP (album + edits and remixes and extended versions).
But I don't see the economical advantage of releasing nothing and earning nothing vs. releasing something and earning something.
Or am I to believe that such a release would create a loss?

But let's not just focus on SDEs.
Let's also consider the lack of releases inbetween.
Yes, it's true, you did give us "Do Me, Baby (Demo)". A single track. From a vault that was overflowing.
Why not throw fans the occasional bone? 
A digital only-release of a concert recording, for instance?
A limited edition collection of long out of print extended versions or B-sides?
Or limited edition releases of albums by associated artists from the Paisley Park Records roster, like Jill Jones? (Preferably including bonus tracks and outtakes etc.)
Or a second volume of *Originals*?

I get it: those things require an investment. 
Tapes need to be pulled from the archive, they need to be digitized and mastered. 
Albums need to be compiled, artwork needs to be commissioned.
Whether all that effort results in a profit is unsure.
But then I see that the 2CD version of Sheena Easton's *A Private Heaven* is sold out on Cherry Red Records' website, and I can't help but wonder:
if a boutique record label can invest money into remastering that album and its singles, and even locating previously unreleased tracks, 
surely the Prince Estate and Warner Bros./Rhino Records and/or Sony/Legacy can do the same?

To return to the topic of SDEs: can you please stop it with the ridiculous lead times? 
The configuration of the *Sign O' The Times* SDE and much of its playlist had leaked before its official announcement -- and that came three months before its release!
Even more ridiculous: *Welcome 2 America* was announced four months before its release.
I understand that you need to drum up excitement. But at some point it just becomes pointless; there is a limit to my anticipation.

Honestly, by now we should be getting two releases per year: a "major" one such as an SDE of a classic album, and a "minor" one Ã  la *Originals*, or an associated artist album).
Or a concert recording from Prince's final tour (which would arguably be a major event).
With inbetween the odd one-off. Perhaps even a freebie.
And please give us worthwhile Record Store Day releases. 
I still don't understand why we didn't get *Camille*; it was an open goal and you didn't even punt.
Yet we did get a truncated edition of *1999*.

Thanks in advance.
