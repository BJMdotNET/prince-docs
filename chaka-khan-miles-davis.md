> On her first album in 12 years, R&B icon Chaka Khan just wants to “keep it light”
> 
> Chaka Khan is releasing her first album in 12 years, but don’t call it a comeback. As far as the 10-time Grammy Award-winning legend is concerned, she never left. “I’ve been on the road constantly,” says Khan, speaking from her home in Los Angeles, “doing the songs that everybody loves to hear. Nobody was asking for nothing new.” Khan, 65, sees herself as a perennial — “a seed that blooms when the season’s right.”
> 
> Apparently, it’s that time. On Feb. 15 she’ll release her 13th studio album, Hello Happiness (Diary Records/Island Records). Its funky lead single, “Like Sugar,” arrived last June and sparked the global #LikeSugarChallenge, a testament to Khan’s staying power after 46 years in the business. Meanwhile, her current single, the new album’s title track, is a testament to her sunnier state of mind. The LP marks Khan’s first since she decided to enter rehab for prescription drug abuse following the death of her “brother,” and former NPG Records boss, Prince.
> 
> Over her career, Khan has talked about various potential one-off recordings, from a jazz album produced by Robert Glasper to a Joni Mitchell covers album. Today, she adds an extraordinary, never-to-be-realized project to the list: a collaborative album she had discussed with Prince and Miles Davis before “they both left.” (Davis played on her 1988 CK track “Sticky Wicked,” which was produced by Prince and Khan.)

> Chaka Khan was a good friend of Miles's and he admired her singing (so much so, that at the following year's Montreux Jazz Festival Khan would sing on-stage with Miles). Miles also admired Prince, so when the latter wrote a tune for Khan's next album, CK. Miles was more than ready to play on it too. Prince and Khan had known each other since the late 197os, when they met in a stu-dio in San Francisco. "Prince wrote the song and 1 liked it and decided to cover it. Miles happened to be around — it was fairly impromptu. Actually Miles wanted to play on every song and I had to tell him 'No, we love you but we can't have you on every track!' It's a shame that we left it so late — we could have done more great things together. In fact, he, Prince and I were planning to get together and do a project. That was our next step after he played on my album." explains Khan. Sadly, this plan would not progress beyond the draw-ing board and it's not entirely certain whether Miles and Prince were ever in the studio together. although Prince claims to have jammed with Miles and recorded the results (see chapter The Road to Tutu - Miles and Prince). 
> 
> "Sticky Wicked" is a song about urban poverty life. although this is not immediately obvious from Prince's enigmatic lyrics. "Most of his songs you have to get the meaning from the context — a lot of it is parabilistic." says Khan. Prince played almost all the instruments on this track, except for the horn section, which is provided by Miles. Atlanta Bliss (trumpet) and Eric Leeds (saxophone). The tune is instantly recognizable as a Prince tune. with funky jangling guitar, a drum machine providing a strong backbeat and stab-bing horn lines — and Prince's left-field lyrics.
