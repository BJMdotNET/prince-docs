On “Too Many Thoughts In My Head,” Cuomo explores new heights with his voice by adding in a surprising falsetto towards the end of the track. The drums and vocals are very repetitive, which make the song quite boring to listen to. However, the track does hold up with the dark theme of “The Black Album” with lyrics like, “I never wanted to be lonely / I never thought that life would turn out like this.” There is not much to say about “The Prince Who Wanted Everything,” other than it is an obvious allusion to the late singer, Prince.
