According to a blogpost on Funky4You -- now only [available through the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20040122053822/http://www.funky4you.com/theundertaker.html)):

> On October 8th 1993, the NPG store invited visitors to view a new concert film, directed by Parris Patton. Less than 50 fans got the chance to see the film (presented by "Bootleg Videos") wich features General Hospital (US TV series) actress Vanessa Marcill, "The Paisley Park Power Trio" (Prince, Michael B and Sonny T), and Steve, as the receptionist. After the showing, questionares were given out and the attendants were asked of their opinions and if they would buy it if it was released as a video. Obvious a success, on December 6th, the NPG store began taking orders for Prince's home video The Undertaker,. The video was a limited edition of 1000 copies at $50 each. Word about this spread very quickly with no promotion at all and the videos sold out at once. More and more demands came by the fans, so The Undertaker were officially released by Warner Music Vision in the UK on March 6th 1994 and later in March in the rest of Europe and Japan, on both VHS and Laser Disc, with art direction and design by B, J.C. Munson and C. Hermes.

The reality is that this initial release never panned out. According to a news item in ***The Prince Family*** (Vol. 2 Issue No. 01 - 8 January 1994):

> More than Prince's name is confusion, as the New Power Generation store in Minneapolis offered for order, then placed on "permanent hold," Prince's "The Undertaker" video. Hopes are that the video may be available soon, perhaps packaged together with the other two new Prince films, "3 Chains O' Gold" and "The Sacrifice Of Victor." "3 Chains O' Gold" is described as being the promised compilation home video containing videos for each song from the ***O(+>*** album with the exception of "Arrogance," "The Sacrifice of Victor" and the song "3 Chains O' Gold" itself. The film "The Sarifice of Victor" primarily contains footage shot at the aftershow Prince performed September 7, 1993 at Bagley's Warehouse in London.
