Links to articles in Prince's hometown paper:

 - [**"Chanhassen residents express differing opinions on plans to develop property once owned by Prince"**](http://www.startribune.com/no-consensus-on-what-to-do-with-sprawling-188-acres-in-chanhassen-once-owned-by-prince/506771122/) by Katy Read, on 6 March 2019:
 
    > An overflow crowd of about 150 jammed a hearing Tuesday in Chanhassen to discuss what to do with a large tract of land once owned by Prince, but no clear consensus emerged among those who spoke.
    
 - [**"Swedish pop star Robyn displays a royal flair in sold-out Palace show -- The dance-pop singer shined in shades of silver, white and especially purple in St. Paul."**](http://www.startribune.com/swedish-pop-star-robyn-displays-a-royal-flair-in-sold-out-palace-show/506763742/) by Chris Riemenschneider, on 6 March 2019:
 
    > Anyone with just basic pop-culture reference points could have spotted traces of Freddie Mercury, Madonna, her homies ABBA and our hometown hero Prince in the way she danced, gestured and all-out glowed during Tuesday’s magnetic set.
    >
    > A Europop vet at age 39 with a very Princely, petite frame, she was overt and unabashed about channeling the local legend’s influence, especially after returning to the stage from her one and only wardrobe change, before the synth-buoyant new song “Because It’s in the Music” a half-hour into the show. Her violet jacket and pants, and “Kiss”-like bump-and-grind dance moves from there on out were all the right shade of Prince.
    >
    > “Thank you for letting me wear my purple suit here,” she commented at show's end. “I couldn’t help myself.”

 - [**"Review: Weezer's 'Black Album' mocks, shocks and knocks"**](http://www.startribune.com/review-weezer-s-black-album-mocks-shocks-and-knocks/506721302/) by Pablo Gorondi (Associated Press), on 5 MARCH 2019
 
      > Fashion and decor experts say black and teal are a good combination, so there are ways in which Weezer's "Black Album" matches the "Teal Album," their barely-a-month-ago release of largely 1980s cover versions motivated by the surprising success of their take on Toto's "Africa."
      > 
      > "Black Album," for example, also harkens back to the '80s "me decade" with some self-referential moments, makes generous use of kitsch and includes "The Prince Who Wanted Everything," a song that alludes to paisley and a red corvette but crassly ends up making Prince come across like a second-rate Liberace.

     > She remembered it. Grammy-winning African star Angelique Kidjo remembered the last time she had played at the Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis 25 years ago.
     >
     > She recalled it for two good reasons: She had just given birth to her daughter about 10 days earlier and she got to hang out at Paisley Park with Prince.

     > Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar referenced the late singer Prince in saying that doctors need to change the prescribing habits of opioids in the United States.
     >
     > The Democratic presidential hopeful spoke Monday night at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire. She says her state still hasn't gotten over the 2016 death of Prince, one of Minnesota's most famous residents. He died of an accidental fentanyl overdose.
