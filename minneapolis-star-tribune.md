 - ["Review: Weezer's 'Black Album' mocks, shocks and knocks"](http://www.startribune.com/review-weezer-s-black-album-mocks-shocks-and-knocks/506721302/) by PABLO GORONDI (Associated Press), on 5 MARCH 2019
 
      > Fashion and decor experts say black and teal are a good combination, so there are ways in which Weezer's "Black Album" matches the "Teal Album," their barely-a-month-ago release of largely 1980s cover versions motivated by the surprising success of their take on Toto's "Africa."
      > 
      > "Black Album," for example, also harkens back to the '80s "me decade" with some self-referential moments, makes generous use of kitsch and includes "The Prince Who Wanted Everything," a song that alludes to paisley and a red corvette but crassly ends up making Prince come across like a second-rate Liberace.
