# Sign O' the Times - the movie

From **"Times Lapse"** by **Calum Waddell** in the News pages of the [April 2019 issue](https://recordcollectormag.com/issue-detail/491) of UK magazine [***Record Collector***](https://recordcollectormag.com/) (issue no. 491), page 13. 

> Unearthed Prince songs and new feature-length documentary on the late artist's Sign 0' The Times concert film.

> **[Susan] Rogers** is also one of many participants from the era taking part in a new, remastered German Blu-Ray of ***Sign O' the Times***, which will include the extensive new documentary **"Sign Language"**, a look back at Prince's concert film project. [...] The German Blu-ray, with accompanying documentary, is slated for a late summer release (a UK Blu-ray release of *Sign O' the Times*, sans documentary, is also due in the UK later in the year).

> "When you see *Sign O' the Times*, you see some expert live musicianship," Rogers says. "Prince made concept albums and, with *Sign O' the Times*, he wanted to make a concept film -- but not many people know that the project was also a document of where his life was at that moment, with a failed engagement to Susan Moonsie, a change in his band and a pensiveness about the future. Now that story will also be told."

The Blu-ray will be released by Turbine Media Group in late Summer 2019.
