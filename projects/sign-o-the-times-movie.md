# Sign O' the Times - the movie

From **"Times Lapse"** by **Calum Waddell** in the News pages of the [April 2019 issue](https://recordcollectormag.com/issue-detail/491) of UK magazine [***Record Collector***](https://recordcollectormag.com/) (issue no. 491), page 13. 

> Unearthed Prince songs and new feature-length documentary on the late artist's *Sign O' the Times* concert film.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **[Susan] Rogers** is also one of many participants from the era taking part in a new, remastered German Blu-Ray of ***Sign O' the Times***, which will include the extensive new documentary **"Sign Language"**, a look back at Prince's concert film project. [...] The German Blu-ray, with accompanying documentary, is slated for a late summer release (a UK Blu-ray release of *Sign O' the Times*, sans documentary, is also due in the UK later in the year). 
> 
> "When you see *Sign O' the Times*, you see some expert live musicianship," Rogers says. "Prince made concept albums and, with *Sign O' the Times*, he wanted to make a concept film -- but not many people know that the project was also a document of where his life was at that moment, with a failed engagement to Susan Moonsie, a change in his band and a pensiveness about the future. Now that story will also be told."

The Blu-ray will be released by [Turbine Media Group](https://www.turbine.de/) in late Summer 2019 ([on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/turbinemedien/)).

Not only are we banging out a 90 minute documentary for the German Blu of this but an added 2 -3 hours of bonus goodies with the interviewees, including cloud guitar hero Dave Rusan. If you love Prince you will want this disc. It's going to be mega.

The living legend Dr Matt Fink in front of the camera. That's a wrap on the filming for Sign o'the Times and an absolutely loaded Blu-Ray from Turbine Entertainment in Germany.

Seeing a bit of talk about our new Prince/ Sign o'the Times documentary online at fan sites. It is English language and it is solely fixed on the Sign tour film. I can't wait for this to be completed. It's incredibly exciting. And we have additional bonus stuff in works too.
