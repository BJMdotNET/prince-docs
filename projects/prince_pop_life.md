 > French-American photographer, art director and film-maker Mathieu Bitton, is co-directing alongside writer, journalist and TV producer Frédéric Bénudis.
 >
 > The documentary features exclusive archive footage, fresh interviews and animated segments created by film-maker Joann Sfar, whose past credits include The Rabbi’s Cat and Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life.

 > “It will be in the same vein as Amy,” said Wild Bunch co-chief Vincent Maraval, referring to Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning portrait of Amy Winehouse.
 >
 > “It will be music driven with a lot of exclusive footage,” said Maraval. “Joann’s animated sections will be there to express Prince’s creativity and the parts of his life when he disappeared from the public eye.”

 > The portrait will be presented as a road trip taking in Paris, LA and New York.
 
However, since then nothing has been heard about this project.
