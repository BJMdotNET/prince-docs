 - [**"Coachella at 20: How the festival unexpectedly nabbed Prince"**](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-coachella-prince-20190409-story.html) by Steve Appleford, 9 April 2019:
 
    > The date for announcing the next Coachella was only weeks away, and Cutler already had a poster made up with Prince’s name on top.

    > “Three weeks before the show,” says Tollett, “I get a call from a private number, and the guy says, ‘My guy wants to talk to you.’” He then heard Prince’s voice on the phone: “Do I have to split the T-shirt proceeds if I put the [Prince] symbol and ‘Coachella’ on a shirt?”

    > “I go, ‘What are you talking about? Are you playing?’ He says, ‘I’m playing the Saturday night.’”
    
    Oh look, yet another one of those "Prince was such a rascal" stories which actually reveal he was a massive asshole who was impossible to work with.
    
    > “I’ve never added a band at the last minute, but I really, really wanted him. I had paid him the most money to play Coachella to that date. It didn’t really work out financially,” Tollett says. It was reported that Prince commanded close to $5 million. His addition turned Saturday into a sell-out.
    
    Also note that yet again Prince is focusing on money.
