GRAMMY-winning singer/songwriter discusses the making of her new album, Tales From The Realm Of The Queen Of Pentacles, and being years ahead of "Game Of Thrones"

Are there any artists you never would have expected to be fans of your work?
Prince wrote me a gorgeous letter after "Luka." Run-D.M.C. told me they liked my records. When I met David Bowie he said, "Suzanne Vega! Finally we meet after all these years!" [That] knocked me out.

[...]

What was your most memorable GRAMMY moment as both a fan and nominee?
Singing "Luka" on the [30th GRAMMY Awards] by myself without a band and seeing Prince jump to his feet in the audience when I finished. That was a great moment for me.

Solitude Standing: Live at the Barbican 2012

Luka 

Now on to the main course: this weekend I was listening to a live recording of one of Suzanne Vega's 2012 concerts for the 25th anniversary of Solitude Standing. After playing "Luka" she ...s anecdote (I've transcribed it):

I certainly have a lot of memories connected with that song (= "Luka") and one of the memories I remember is that back then in 1987 right after the song had come out and was a hit at radio but it hadn't occurred to me yet to change the order of the setlist so I was still singing it fourth in the setlist.

When I played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, we had a guest who wanted to come to the show and that was Prince. And he was a big fan of the song and he has written me a letter and he wanted to come to the show and I said "Oh, that would be great." But what I didn't realise is that Prince was not just going to come and sit in the audience; Prince wanted to come by himself and he wanted to come into the venue after everyone was seated.

And so Prince came in with his bodyguards after everyone was seated and he sat on the flight cases on the side of the stage and I played "Luke" fourth in the set. He got up apparently and danced and then after the song left the building [laughter erupts in the audience] with his bodyguards and I never saw him. I think Mike actually, Mike Visceglia on bass, was with me at that time, he saw Prince dancing in the corner, so that's how I found out he was even at the show.

IMHO that was a bit dickish of Prince: demanding special treatment and then not even having the courtesy to stay the entire gig or meet with Vega.

Perhaps the good folks at PrinceVault could add this date and story to their fine website; source is http://www.kudosrecords.c..._2012.html

Vega played the Orpheum Theatre on 15 July 1987.
