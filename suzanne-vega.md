On her album [***Solitude Standing: Live at the Barbican***](http://www.kudosrecords.co.uk/release/CLDL419/Suzanne_Vega_Solitude_Standing_Live_2012.html), a live recording of one of Suzanne Vega's 2012 concerts for the 25th anniversary of ***Solitude Standing***, recorded on 16 October 2012 at the Barbican Centre in London, she shared this anecdote after playing "Luka" (my transcription):

> I certainly have a lot of memories connected with that song (= "Luka") and one of the memories I remember is that back then in 1987 right after the song had come out and was a hit at radio but it hadn't occurred to me yet to change the order of the setlist so I was still singing it fourth in the setlist.
> 
> When I played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, we had a guest who wanted to come to the show and that was Prince. And he was a big fan of the song and he has written me a letter and he wanted to come to the show and I said "Oh, that would be great." But what I didn't realise is that Prince was not just going to come and sit in the audience; Prince wanted to come by himself and he wanted to come into the venue after everyone was seated.
> 
> And so Prince came in with his bodyguards after everyone was seated and he sat on the flight cases on the side of the stage and I played "Luke" fourth in the set. He got up apparently and danced and then after the song left the building [laughter erupts in the audience] with his bodyguards and I never saw him. I think Mike actually, Mike Visceglia on bass, was with me at that time, he saw Prince dancing in the corner, so that's how I found out he was even at the show.

Suzanne Vega played the [Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis](https://hennepintheatretrust.org/theatres/orpheum-theatre/) on 15 July 1987.

After Prince's death in 2016, [she shared the letter on Twitter](https://twitter.com/suzyv/status/724728422006554624). [According to *Billboard*](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7341897/suzanne-vega-prince-handwritten-letter-luka):

> The letter calls her "Dearest Suzanne" and says, "Luka is the most compelling piece of music I've heard in a long time. There are no words 2 tell you all the things I feel when I hear it. I thank God 4 u." It also includes a nice doodle of a flower.
