> A source also told Variety that a documentary about Prince and the Revolution’s legendary concert at Minneapolis’ First Avenue in August of 1983 has landed at Apple Music. The show marked the debut of guitarist Wendy Melvoin and the “Purple Rain”-era incarnation of the Revolution, along with the premieres of several songs that would later appear in the album and film nearly a year later (in fact, the album versions of three of those songs were recorded at the show, albeit with significant overdubs added later).

> Video and audio recordings from the concert and its rehearsals have been circulating on bootleg for many years, and feature a longer take of “Purple Rain” with an additional, seemingly ad-libbed verse that was dropped from the official version. Another song from the concert, “Electric Intercourse,” was originally mooted for the album but was replaced by the similar but superior song, “The Beautiful Ones.” A studio version of “Electric Intercourse” was finally released on the “Purple Rain” deluxe edition in 2017, although many fans consider the live version to be better.
