The Prince of Paisley Park 

Prince is the legendary genius of contemporary pop music. His talents as a prolific songwriter, musician, record producer and dynamic live performer have been acknowledged by fans, critics and contemporaries worldwide. Tonight's Omnibus was filmed in Minneapolis and at Prince's own Paisley Park studios. The programme includes exclusive footage, never seen before, of Prince in rehearsals, performing at special after-concert parties and benefits, and provides an insight into the working methods of a unique talent.
