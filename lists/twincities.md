    > OK, Minnesota, we need to talk about Prince. It’s time to let the man rest in peace.
    > 
    > In the last full week of April alone there were 15 Prince-related events one could attend in the greater Twin Cities, from a “tribute” pub crawl to last weekend’s Celebration 2019 at Paisley Park Studio, where a regular ticket cost $549 and a VIP pass was $1,049.
    > 
    > There’s a fine line between heartfelt tribute and brazen cash grab, and the Rubicon has been crossed. Since his untimely death on April 21, 2016, a cottage industry has sprung up around the iconoclastic, and famously private, musician.
