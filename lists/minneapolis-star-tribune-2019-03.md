    > Grantis’ own combo delivers new millennium instrumental jazz-rock fusion, sort of like Jeff Beck meets a postmodern Mahavishnu Orchestra. The ensemble travels down eight different lanes of the fusion superhighway in Hendrixian crosstown traffic, all with an exotic East Indian undertone thanks to tabla player Suphala.

    > Donna Grantis, "Diamonds & Dynamite" (eOne)
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Recorded live-to-tape in just two days, a pace similar to that of many great jazz albums, "Diamonds & Dynamite" is an experimentally adventurous set, which contains ample evidence why Prince held Grantis in such high regard.

 - [**"Urn with Prince's ashes still in the building, 'just not on display' at Paisley Park"**](http://www.startribune.com/urn-with-prince-s-ashes-still-in-the-building-just-not-on-display-at-paisley-park/507434942/) by Jon Bream - 20 March 2019

    > His ashes are no longer on display for tours at Paisley Park museum. And fans are disappointed.

 - [**"Colbert's bandleader Jon Batiste honors Prince in final 'Live From Here' St. Paul show of the season"**](http://www.startribune.com/colbert-s-bandleader-jon-batiste-honors-prince-in-live-from-here-s-last-st-paul-show-of-the-season/507271362/) by Neal Justin - 18 March 2019

    > "Live From Here" may be drifting away from its Minnesota roots, but the national radio show found all sorts of ways to pay tribute to the state with its last Twin Cities show of the season and its first without host Chris Thile.
    > 
    > Guest host Jon Batiste, best known as the bandleader for CBS's "Late Show With Stephen Colbert," talked about how he spent time in college obsessed with Prince's "Dirty Mind" album before steaming up the Fitzgerald Theatre with a sulty, jazz version of "How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore."

 - [**"Chanhassen City Council approves housing and park plan on former Prince property"**](http://www.startribune.com/chanhassen-council-approves-housing-and-park-plan-on-former-prince-property/507037042/)) by David Chanen and Katy Read - 12 March 2019

    > A long-running dispute over development of land once owned by Prince appears to be settled. The Chanhassen City Council voted 5-0 Monday for a plan that includes 169 lots for market-rate and luxury houses on the 188-acre site, between Galpin Boulevard and the shore of lakes Ann and Lucy.

 - [**"Paisley Park rocks again with four of Prince's female protégées in concert"**](http://www.startribune.com/paisley-park-rocks-again-with-four-of-prince-s-female-protegees-in-concert/507037812/) by Jon Bream - 12 March 2019

    > Prince never presented a concert featuring all female-fronted bands, but he probably would have approved of the #WomenWhoRock at Paisley Park event on Monday night. It was an invigorating, enlightening and entertaining five-hour testament to women whose music he nurtured and championed.

 - [**"Chanhassen residents express differing opinions on plans to develop property once owned by Prince"**](http://www.startribune.com/no-consensus-on-what-to-do-with-sprawling-188-acres-in-chanhassen-once-owned-by-prince/506771122/) by Katy Read - 6 March 2019

    > An overflow crowd of about 150 jammed a hearing Tuesday in Chanhassen to discuss what to do with a large tract of land once owned by Prince, but no clear consensus emerged among those who spoke.

 - [**"Swedish pop star Robyn displays a royal flair in sold-out Palace show -- The dance-pop singer shined in shades of silver, white and especially purple in St. Paul."**](http://www.startribune.com/swedish-pop-star-robyn-displays-a-royal-flair-in-sold-out-palace-show/506763742/) by Chris Riemenschneider - 6 March 2019

    > Anyone with just basic pop-culture reference points could have spotted traces of Freddie Mercury, Madonna, her homies ABBA and our hometown hero Prince in the way she danced, gestured and all-out glowed during Tuesday’s magnetic set.
    > 
    > A Europop vet at age 39 with a very Princely, petite frame, she was overt and unabashed about channeling the local legend’s influence, especially after returning to the stage from her one and only wardrobe change, before the synth-buoyant new song “Because It’s in the Music” a half-hour into the show. Her violet jacket and pants, and “Kiss”-like bump-and-grind dance moves from there on out were all the right shade of Prince.
    > 
    > “Thank you for letting me wear my purple suit here,” she commented at show's end. “I couldn’t help myself.”

 - [**"Review: Weezer's 'Black Album' mocks, shocks and knocks"**](http://www.startribune.com/review-weezer-s-black-album-mocks-shocks-and-knocks/506721302/) by Pablo Gorondi (Associated Press) - 5 March 2019

    > Fashion and decor experts say black and teal are a good combination, so there are ways in which Weezer's "Black Album" matches the "Teal Album," their barely-a-month-ago release of largely 1980s cover versions motivated by the surprising success of their take on Toto's "Africa."
    > 
    > "Black Album," for example, also harkens back to the '80s "me decade" with some self-referential moments, makes generous use of kitsch and includes "The Prince Who Wanted Everything," a song that alludes to paisley and a red corvette but crassly ends up making Prince come across like a second-rate Liberace.
