 - [**"Nerdy comic-musician Fred Armisen salutes Prince, Grant Hart at First Avenue"**](http://www.startribune.com/nerdy-comic-musician-fred-armisen-salutes-prince-grant-hart-at-first-avenue/510055762/) by Jon Bream - 17 May 2019 ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.startribune.com/nerdy-comic-musician-fred-armisen-salutes-prince-grant-hart-at-first-avenue/510055762/))

    > The show is billed as Comedy for Musicians But Everyone Is Welcome, and you couldn’t find a more apt description of Fred Armisen’s performance Thursday night at sold-out First Avenue in Minneapolis.
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > And, yes, Armisen went to Paisley Park before Thursday’s gig. Surprisingly, he left his Purple references to a minimum at First Ave except for mentioning that the first time he was in Minneapolis, he had someone drive him to Chanhassen, look at the outside of Paisley Park and then drive him back downtown.
    > 
    > And, of course, Armisen accommodated a fan’s request for a taste of “The Prince Show,” a SNL bit in which Armisen portrays Prince as a talk show host with Beyonce (played by Maya Rudolph) as his sidekick. Armisen strummed the theme song on guitar and then led the crowd in a sing-long of “Raspberry Beret.”

    > There’s something special about Lizz Wright at the Dakota.
    > 
    > Maybe it’s because the gospel-soul-jazz-folk singer from Georgia was jazzed about the full house that showed up to see her Wednesday night even though she doesn’t have a new record out.
    > 
    > Maybe it’s because she shook the tambourine that Prince gave her there three years ago – at what turned out to be the last concert he saw, a mere two days before he died. (She said she should probably have put the tambourine in a frame.)

    > Starting in the late 1970s, alt-weekly writer Martin Keller and photographer Greg Helgeson chronicled the birth of the Minneapolis Sound, the modern-rock revolution and the 1980s comedy boom.
    > 
    > The two seemed to be everywhere on the scene, “perpetually walking the thin-grooved line between fandom and journalism,” as Keller puts it in their new paperback, “Hijinx and Hearsay: Scenester Stories From Minnesota’s Pop Life” ($25, Minnesota Historical Society Press). Part photo book, part “fragmented memoir,” it summons an entire era in chatty chapters packed with revelatory images.

    > Helgeson took this portrait of the former Time members just as their hitmaking career was taking off in 1984. “Jimmy has always been the more outspoken of the two, while Terry is typically the more introspective one, but his funny one-liners will catch you off guard and deliver the money quote.”

    > Prince during his first concert as a solo artist, in January 1979 at the Capri Theater in north Minneapolis. Keller interviewed him later that year: “He sat on the kitchen floor in Bobby Z’s apartment, his hair in long, cornrow braids and his guard up.” They didn’t have another sit-down until 1996 at Paisley Park, when Keller shared some vegetarian bean soup cooked by Prince’s then-wife, Mayte. “I think God puts you in the place you’re supposed to be,” the singer said. “Flying back from a concert tour from around the world, and you look down over the land and all the beautiful lakes, and it just feels like home, that this is where I belong.”

Here are 10 things you'll learn about Minnesota's most fabled nightclub."**](http://www.startribune.com/10-things-you-ll-learn-about-first-avenue-in-new-minnesota-history-center-show/509374312/) by Jon Bream - 3 May 2019 ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.startribune.com/10-things-you-ll-learn-about-first-avenue-in-new-minnesota-history-center-show/509374312/))

    > The History Center show includes an exhibit on Prince and “Purple Rain,” which was filmed at the club. The image projected at center was shot by Star Tribune photographer David Brewster at the 1983 concert where Prince debuted — and recorded — many of the songs for the film.

    > 
    > Let's dance: Renamed Uncle Sam's, the club operated as a “danceteria” for the latter half of the '70s as part of a national chain. It became simply Sam's in '79, and began adding more live music. It adopted its current name on Jan. 1, 1982, in honor of the street where it's located. Museumgoers can dance on a 1970s disco floor, complete with blinking lights, or geek out over DJ Spinlove's turntables, loaded with a pre-release copy of Prince's “Erotic City” (the superstar often brought in records for DJs to test-drive).
    > 
    > When you were mine: Even though “Purple Rain” put First Avenue on the map, Prince headlined the 1,500-capacity mainroom only nine times, starting March 9, 1981. He debuted the music for “Purple Rain” there on Aug. 3, 1983. Then in November, he rented the club for a month to shoot the film. The cops shut down his final First Ave performance — on 7/7/07 — because it was after 3 a.m. Before the show, club staffers had to cover up a mural, depicting Leonardo da Vinci's “Leda and the Swan,” because it offended his beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness.
