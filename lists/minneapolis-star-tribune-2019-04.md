    > A couple enduring Minnesota bands landed stars on the walls of First Avenue this past week – although in the case of Prince’s bandmates in the Revolution, it was a case of getting theirs back.
    > 
    > Together again to perform for Paisley Park's Celebration on Sunday, Mark Brown, Wendy Melvoin, Lisa Coleman, Bobby Z and, “Dr.” Matt Fink were all on hand Monday for the unveiling of their new silver star outside the old black rock hall, which appropriately sits right next to the oft-photographed gold star of their late bandleader and friend. Not to mention, a little band named Nirvana is on the other side.
    > 
    > Maybe it’s because she shook the tambourine that Prince gave her there three years ago – at what turned out to be the last concert he saw, a mere two days before he died. (She said she should probably have put the tambourine in a frame.)
    > 
    > A performer at the club even before he teamed up with Prince – he drummed along to disco records as a teen when the club was still Uncle Sam’s – Bobby Z said, “We are thrilled to have our star next to our mentor.”
    > 
    > “So much of our history was made behind these walls. We would like to thank Prince, First Avenue and all of our fans around the world for the love and support.”

    > On Friday, the Big Screen show was reprised at the Armory in Minneapolis. The revamped fortress with its wonderfully upgraded acoustics is half the size of the Timberwolves’ arena. And, as was the case last year, the place was only half full, with about 3,000 people.

    > Here’s a rundown of what’s new, and what’s expected soon, from his famously overstuffed vault.
    > 
    > A new album: “Originals” — a collection of his original versions of songs that he wrote for other artists — is being announced Thursday at the third annual Celebration at Paisley Park. The single-disc record will include Prince’s takes on the Bangles’ “Manic Monday,” the Time’s “Jungle Love,” Sheila E’s “The Glamorous Life,” Kenny Rogers’ “You’re My Love,” Vanity 6’s “Sex Shooter,” Martika’s “Love … Thy Will Be Done” and the Family’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Due: June 7, Prince’s birthday, exclusively on Tidal. Available elsewhere on June 21.
    > 
    > His memoir: “The Beautiful Ones” will finally be published in the fall. Prince himself announced the project at a New York City news conference that included a half-hour performance in March 2016, weeks before his death. He collaborated with writer Dan Piepenbring of the Paris Review on some of the text. Random House raided Prince’s vault for personal photos as well as handwritten lyrics and the treatment he wrote for the movie “Purple Rain.” Due: Oct. 29.
    > 
    > “1999” reissue. Like the special edition of “Purple Rain” released last year, this 1982 double disc, featuring “Little Red Corvette” and “Delirious,” will receive a deluxe treatment with outtakes and alternate tracks. Due: During the holiday season.
    > 
    > “Ultimate Rave”: This triple-disc set packages two albums — 1999’s “Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic” (featuring guests Chuck D, Eve, Gwen Stefani, Ani DiFranco and Sheryl Crow) and its 2001 remix “Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic” — plus a DVD of Prince’s 1999 pay-per-view New Year’s bash, “Rave Un2 the Year 2000,” with Morris Day & the Time, Maceo Parker, Larry Graham, George Clinton and Lenny Kravitz. Due: Friday.
    > 
    > Netflix documentary: “Selma” and “A Wrinkle in Time” filmmaker Ava DuVernay — whose documentary work includes “13th” and the hip-hop flick “This Is the Life” — was tapped by the Prince estate to direct an in-depth look at the Purple One as an artist. Rumor is Prince himself approached her about working together. Due: Unknown.
    > 
    > Apple Music documentary: A British film crew has been working on a documentary about Prince’s legendary First Avenue concert on Aug. 3, 1983, the night he not only debuted the songs for “Purple Rain” but recorded them for the film’s soundtrack. (Three tracks captured live are heard on the final album.) It was also the night 19-year-old Wendy Melvoin made her debut as the Revolution’s guitarist. Due: unknown.

    > A new Prince album featuring his versions of songs he wrote for other artists will be released in June.
    >

    > At least one member of the Purple Family resolved some long-standing issues on Thursday at Paisley Park.
    > 
    > Jesse Johnson, guitarist for the Time, was very close with Prince in the 1980s — like brothers, the guitarist said — but they had a falling out. The depth of their divisions went viral this year when Johnson, in a private conversation, was captured on YouTube dissing Prince and saying he’d never play at a Purple tribute.
    > 
    > On Thursday, Johnson turned an interview session at Paisley into a 45-minute confessional monologue. A little wacky, a little humorous and totally heartfelt.

    > LP Music: As part of unofficial Prince Week, two veteran players from his orbit — NPG and Madhouse saxophonist Eric Leeds and multi-instrumentalist St. Paul Peterson of the Time and the Family— do their funky jazz thing. Their all-star Twin Cities ensemble will include drummer Petar Janjic, percussionist Marc Anderson and keyboardists Brian Z and Ricky Peterson, on break from the Fleetwood Mac tour. (11 p.m. Fri. Icehouse, $30)

    > [...]
    > 
    > Prince Live on the Big Screen: For the second year in a row, it's a concert video of the late Prince on a giant video screen with a live band of NPG alums onstage. It's oddly emotional but it worked musically last year at Target Center. The venue this time is half that size. (8 p.m. Fri., Armory, $49-$199)
    > 
    > Love 2 the 9's: With all the high-profile hubbub of Prince Week, here's a chill Purple happening. NPG keyboardist Tommy Barbarella will accompany Twin Cities vocalist Julius Collins, a veteran of Greazy Meal and various theater productions, in an intimate evening of Prince music. Collins has fronted a bunch of NPG alums (including Michael Bland, Sonny Thompson and Barbarella) for full-band Prince tribute shows. (11 p.m. Sat., Parkway Theater, $55-$129, theparkwaytheater.com)

    > Bourn also owned, operated and rented out theatrical spotlights like the Super Trouper models immortalized in an ABBA song. He put the spotlight on rock acts, professional wrestlers, ice skating shows, circuses and monster truck competitions at venues ranging from the Minnesota State Fair grandstand to the Metrodome.
    > 
    > When scenes from the 1984 film “Purple Rain” were shot at First Avenue, two of Bourn’s spotlights were used to shine on Prince. Bourn operated one, his son Brian ran the other.

    > Playing the Fine Line in Minneapolis will be bittersweet Saturday for singer Ashley Támar Davis.
    > 
    > She’s scheduled to go on stage at 9 p.m. as the special guest of New Power Generation, a few days after the third anniversary of Prince’s death. She looks forward to performing “Redhead Stepchild,” the song she coproduced with Prince and doesn’t believe has been performed here since 2006.
    > 
    > “He came into my life when I was 13, 14. That’s when he was officially introduced. I received paraphernalia. I saw the ‘Purple Rain’ bike. I got a glimpse of everything Paisley. I went to a concert at Paisley, my second concert. I wasn’t star-struck. I guess it was a premonition of [him being] family, not knowing later on I would actually work with him,” she said.
    > 
    > “I didn’t officially work with him until 2005. I elaborate on all the stories in detail in my memoir. The book was written seven years ago. I was approached [by] a boutique publisher in Houston, and I just didn’t feel the time was right to put it out. But it’s completed, and when he passed, I had to edit it.

    > The memoir Prince was working on at the time of his death is coming out Oct. 29.
    > 
    > Random House confirmed Monday to The Associated Press that “The Beautiful Ones” will combine a Prince unfinished manuscript with rare photos, scrapbooks and lyrics. First announced just weeks before his 2016 death, the 288-page book will include an introduction by Dan Piepenbring, whom Prince had chosen as a collaborator. The memoir is an exclusive partnership with the Prince Estate.

    > “The Beautiful Ones” was originally announced in March 2016, at an ad hoc news conference in New York City where Prince plugged the book, took no questions from the media and performed a half-hour concert.
    > 
    > Prince picked writer Dan Piepenbring of The Paris Review as his collaborator.  The two had come up with about 50 pages of text, enough to convince Random House to buy the book for an undisclosed sum. The book was to arrive by fall 2017.
    > 
    > In spring of last year, two years after Prince’s death, his representative Esther Newberg, one of the publishing world’s most powerful literary agents, announced that the book would be available by holiday time.
    > 
    > That promise, like so many things in the posthumous Prince world, proved not to be true.

    > Cavallo, leader of a three-man team that managed Prince from 1979 to ’89, has countless tales about the Minnesota icon who died three years ago this Sunday. He’ll discuss “Purple Rain” on a panel next weekend as part of the third annual Celebration at Prince’s Paisley Park studio in Chanhassen. (Read about other highlights of the week here.)
    > 
    > He and Prince had a falling-out before the star’s third movie, 1990’s “Graffiti Bridge.” Cavallo went on to start another management firm (its clients included Green Day, Seal and Alanis Morissette), and produce such movies as “City of Angels” and “12 Monkeys.” In 1998, he took over Disney’s music division, working with everyone from Miley Cyrus to the Plain White T’s.

    > Less controversial were the comic’s fond memories of his late pal Prince. He opened the show by leading the crowd in an a cappella version of “1999” and returned to the number several times, sharing some intimate anecdotes in between.
    > 
    > “My dream as a kid was that Eddie Murphy and Prince would pick me up after school,” he said. “And then they became my friends.”
    > 
    > Chappelle said that through his friendship with the late legend, he came to appreciate how special Minneapolis truly was. He praised Minnesota for continually sending “wild” politicians to Washington. He christened the tribute with a sip of a fan’s locally brewed Surly beer.

    > “Tastes a little racist,” he quipped.

    > A St. Paul seminary has launched a project called the Theology of Prince, which explores the spiritual influence of the artist better known for his music than divine inspiration. What started as a contest to reveal how Prince influenced fans’ spiritual lives has resulted in a nearly 400-page online Theology of Prince journal, an online gallery, and educational events now and for the future.
    > 
    > “Even though he sold more than 100 million records and won seven Grammy Awards, little is known about the impact religion and spirituality had on his [Prince’s] music and artistic expression,” said Pamela Ayo Yetunde, an assistant professor at United Theological Seminary in St. Paul, who heads the Theology of Prince committee. “Yet who has not had a ‘holy’ moment listening to one of Prince’s songs or attending one of his concerts?”

Despite a dearth of historic visuals, ESPN managed to entertainingly explore Prince’s love of hoops by interviewing a coach and teammate from Central High, Sheila E, Micki Free and others who played basketball with him. This Final Four piece was enhanced by an artist’s sketches of Prince playing.
