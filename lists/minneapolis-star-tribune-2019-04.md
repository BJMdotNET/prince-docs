Self-confidence, says the manager who landed 'Purple Rain' -- Bob Cavallo recounts some of the tales he'll tell at Paisley Park for the third annual Celebration."**](http://www.startribune.com/prince-s-greatest-talent-self-confidence-says-the-manager-who-landed-purple-rain/508774052/) by Jon Bream - 19 April 2019

    > Cavallo had to beg Prince to write a hit song for the movie.
    > 
    > “When you said ‘Write a hit,’ he wrote a hit. This time it was ‘Kiss.’”
	
	Except this isn't true. The story of the recording of "Kiss" is well-known and well-documented.
	
	> “He totally, totally did not care a whit about budgets, money, etc. Before we finally parted ways, he was spending, I’d say, over $100,000 a week making videos at Paisley Park that meant nothing. [For] girls he met. He’d fly cameramen in. He was unstoppable.”
	
	Prince fans babble endlessly about his charitable work, which often wasn't anything more than Prince dropping a couple of thousands. Meanwhile he used to spent untold amounts on vanity projects.

    > A St. Paul seminary has launched a project called the Theology of Prince, which explores the spiritual influence of the artist better known for his music than divine inspiration. What started as a contest to reveal how Prince influenced fans’ spiritual lives has resulted in a nearly 400-page online Theology of Prince journal, an online gallery, and educational events now and for the future.
    > 
    > “Even though he sold more than 100 million records and won seven Grammy Awards, little is known about the impact religion and spirituality had on his [Prince’s] music and artistic expression,” said Pamela Ayo Yetunde, an assistant professor at United Theological Seminary in St. Paul, who heads the Theology of Prince committee. “Yet who has not had a ‘holy’ moment listening to one of Prince’s songs or attending one of his concerts?”
