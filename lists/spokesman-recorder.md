    > Yet by this time, the songs that graced each Prince album — as good as they were — did not always fully satiate the most hardcore fans who knew there was more to be heard. That’s because Prince started to employ what noted author Michaelangelo Matos adroitly refers to as a “Prince’s B-side strategy.”
	>
	> Instead of delivering singles that contained an additional album track as its B-side, Prince would offer a brand new song to accompany most of the singles he released.
	>
	> Granted, Prince was not the first artist to do such a thing. However, unlike other artists, the songs that Prince chose as B-sides were almost never deemed “throwaways” or “filler;” these tracks were gems, some of which are now considered all-time fan favorites.

    > If you think Misty Copeland stands strong in those ballet slippers as the first Black principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater, wait until you hear her talk about the importance of Black unity and upliftment. Her passion for the subject will be on full display at “INSPIRED: A Conversation with Misty Copeland” at the U of M’s Northrop Auditorium on Sunday night. The event will benefit Northrop’s youth programs.
