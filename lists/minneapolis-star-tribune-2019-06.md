    > Mazarati: With "100 MPH," the tune Prince wrote for them, appearing on his just-released "Originals" album, it seems like an opportune time for Terry Casey and the mid-'80s Minneapolis rockin' funkateers, under the tutelage of producer Brown Mark, to reunite for the first time in 10 years. It's on the Purple One's birthday, no less. Will they do "Kiss," which was originally intended for them? Brown Mark and Micki Free are scheduled to appear as well. (9 p.m. Fri., Muse, Mpls., $28-$80.)

    > Ingrid Chavez: A Prince protégé going back to the "Lovesexy" album who later starred opposite him in the movie "Graffiti Bridge" she's hitting Prince's favorite local record shop to perform and sign her personal and poetic new album, "Memories of Flying." (7 p.m. Fri., Electric Fetus, Mpls., free.)
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Maceo Parker: The longtime James Brown saxophonist and sometime sideman to George Clinton and Prince always brings the funk, adding a special Purple touch when he comes to town. His performance with special guest Candy Dulfer was a treat last year at the PRN Alumni Foundation fundraiser. (7 & 9 p.m. Tue., Dakota, $25-$50)

    > By the mid-1980s, the Bangles were already a successful band, touring across the world with airplay on college radio, but they hadn't hit the mainstream in a major way. That's when Prince gave them the gift of a lifetime by crafting a perfect piece of pop confection known to the masses as “Manic Monday.”
    > 
    > The midtempo ditty about the frustrations about the start of the workweek, released in 1986, became their first top 10 hit, paving the way for a slew of others to come.
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Prince's mastery in songwriting didn't just benefit the Bangles: The late superstar penned some of the biggest hits of other acts' careers, from Sinead O'Connor's “Nothing Compares 2 U” to Sheila E's “The Glamorous Life.”
    > 
    > Demo versions of those songs and more appear on the new posthumous album, “Originals.” Jay-Z helped select the songs on the album, which will be available on the music mogul's Tidal streaming platform exclusively for two weeks starting Friday, which would have been Prince's 61st birthday. The album will be widely available on June 21.

    > In interviews with the AP, Hoffs, Apollonia Kotero, Susannah Melvoin and Taja Sevelle explain the magic behind the songs Prince wrote for them years ago.
