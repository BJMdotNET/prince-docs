    > A first-of-a-kind Prince merch store opened quietly at the MSP Airport Monday, but fans sniffed it out.
    > 
    > Prince fans were lined up and so eager to get inside a new retail store at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, they persuaded the staff to open doors 45 minutes early on opening day Monday.
    > 
    > The store, located in the main mall area at Terminal 1 near the south checkpoint, is the first of its kind and packed with more items than the gift shop at Paisley Park, which had been the only brick-and-mortar site with an expanded line of official Prince merchandise.
    > 
    > Branded simply as Prince, the store sells t-shirts, concert paraphernalia, albums, books, CDs and movies as well as keychains, magnets, stickers and other trinkets. There are Minnesota-themed items, such as a Twins baseball mug with the Prince love symbol.

 - [**"Prince rules collector site Discogs' '100 Most Expensive Records' list"**](http://www.startribune.com/prince-rules-collector-site-discogs-100-most-expensive-records-list/511122062/) by Chris Riemenschneider - 11 June 2019 ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.startribune.com/prince-rules-collector-site-discogs-100-most-expensive-records-list/511122062/))

    > Record geeks love Prince and his unconventional release methods. That was made obvious again by the predominant album-collectors website Discogs, which just issued a new list Monday of the “Top 100 Most Expensive Records,” culled from its 14 years in the business of buying and selling rare music items.
    > 
    > Prince's infamously shelved “Black Album” appears three times in the top 100, including the top spot, after a diehard fan of the late Minneapolis icon paid $15,000 for a 1987 promo version of the LP via the website. That's more than twice the price paid for the next-highest record on the list, a 78-rpm shellac record on the Vocalion label by blues pioneer Charley Patton.

    > That experience led Fordice to ask Curious Minnesota: Why won’t anyone take the last piece?
    > 
    > It comes down to basic politeness, said Estelle Thielen of Eagan, who would never dream of taking the last piece.
    > 
    > “It’s Minnesota Nice,” she said. “If you take the last piece, nobody else can have any.”
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Our favorite explanation is one that’s not likely.
    > 
    > But it’s lovely.
    > 
    > It came from an anonymous Twitter user, who simply said, “We leave the last piece for Prince.”

    > When Prince showed up at his favorite Los Angeles recording studio, engineer Peggy McCreary never knew what was going to happen.
    > 
    > “It wasn’t like you could ask him,” she recalled. “He was very quiet. I got in his face: ‘You’re gonna have to talk to me. I can’t work if you’re just going to mumble instructions.’”
    > 
    > They worked together for six years, beginning in 1981, at Sunset Sound, recording “Controversy,” “1999,” “Purple Rain” and other projects.
    >

    > Mazarati: With “100 MPH,” the tune Prince wrote for them, appearing on his just-released “Originals” album, it seems like an opportune time for Terry Casey and the mid-'80s Minneapolis rockin' funkateers, under the tutelage of producer Brown Mark, to reunite for the first time in 10 years. It's on the Purple One's birthday, no less. Will they do “Kiss,” which was originally intended for them? Brown Mark and Micki Free are scheduled to appear as well. (9 p.m. Fri., Muse, Mpls., $28-$80.)
    > 
    > Ingrid Chavez: A Prince protégé going back to the “Lovesexy” album who later starred opposite him in the movie “Graffiti Bridge” she's hitting Prince's favorite local record shop to perform and sign her personal and poetic new album, “Memories of Flying.” (7 p.m. Fri., Electric Fetus, Mpls., free.)
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Maceo Parker: The longtime James Brown saxophonist and sometime sideman to George Clinton and Prince always brings the funk, adding a special Purple touch when he comes to town. His performance with special guest Candy Dulfer was a treat last year at the PRN Alumni Foundation fundraiser. (7 & 9 p.m. Tue., Dakota, $25-$50)

    > By the mid-1980s, the Bangles were already a successful band, touring across the world with airplay on college radio, but they hadn't hit the mainstream in a major way. That's when Prince gave them the gift of a lifetime by crafting a perfect piece of pop confection known to the masses as “Manic Monday.”
    > 
    > The midtempo ditty about the frustrations about the start of the workweek, released in 1986, became their first top 10 hit, paving the way for a slew of others to come.
    > 
    > [...]
    > 
    > Prince's mastery in songwriting didn't just benefit the Bangles: The late superstar penned some of the biggest hits of other acts' careers, from Sinead O'Connor's “Nothing Compares 2 U” to Sheila E's “The Glamorous Life.”
    > 
    > Demo versions of those songs and more appear on the new posthumous album, “Originals.” Jay-Z helped select the songs on the album, which will be available on the music mogul's Tidal streaming platform exclusively for two weeks starting Friday, which would have been Prince's 61st birthday. The album will be widely available on June 21.
    > 
    > In interviews with the AP, Hoffs, Apollonia Kotero, Susannah Melvoin and Taja Sevelle explain the magic behind the songs Prince wrote for them years ago.
