       > The elite LA based celebrity hairstylist is excited to add “Author” to her long list of accomplishments. Taking a page from Prince’s playbook, the new memoir was conceptualized, written and self-published by Berry (KimBOnSet Publishing). Through fabulously told personal accounts of tour life experiences and other shared moments with Prince, Berry brings this labor of love to the masses. A captivating, heartfelt recollection of her journey alongside one of music’s most prolific artists. Berry’s desire for the book is to serve as a healing agent for peace to all who have never truly received closure after his death, nearly three years later.
