From **"Acute jangle"** by **Rob Hughes** in the [April 2019 issue](https://recordcollectormag.com/issue-detail/491) of UK magazine [***Record Collector***](https://recordcollectormag.com/) (issue no. 491), page 75:

> LA was all hair metal and synth-pop in the early 80s. Enter **The Bangles**, **Rain Parade**, **The Dream Syndicate** and **The Three O'Clock**, with their loud guitars and bags of post-punk attitude, heralding the birth of **The Paisley Underground**. "We wanted to drag the 60s kicking and screaming into the 80s," **Susanna Hoffs** tells Rob Hughes.

> The psychedelic inference of Paisley Underground, in the meantime, had piqued the interest of one of the decade's new superstars. **Prince** came knocking at The Bangles' door after he'd taken a shine to one of their singles, **"Hero Takes A Fall"** (ostensibly about Wynn). "Within a few days of hearing **"When Doves Cry"** on the radio for the first time, somebody came up to me and said, 'Do you know that Prince really likes The Bangles?'" recalls Hoffs. "He'd seen the song on MTV and the next thing I knew he'd just pop up at our shows. And several times he'd get up onstage with us. We jammed with him a couple of years later, after he'd invited us to Sunset Sound, on Sunset Boulevard. He just wanted to play Bangles songs. He knew them all, which was crazy. That was when he offered us the cassette with **"Manic Monday"** on it."

> It proved a game-changer. The Bangles' recording of "Manic Monday", released in January 1986, was a massive international hit, reaching the second spot on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK charts. Parent album ***Different Light*** went triple platinum.
