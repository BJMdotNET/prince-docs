    > Freur tanked and the first iteration of Underworld (as a funk-rock seven-piece which launched in 1986) didn’t fare much better. At the onset of the 1990s, Hyde and Smith were high, dry and some sixty thousand pounds in debt. But they were little perturbed. Staying in the US following Underworld Mark One’s final tour, **Karl spent a few months playing guitar in Blondie and working as a session musician at Prince’s Paisley Park.** When Hyde finally returned to the UK, he found that Rick had recruited 17-year-old DJ and gadget freak Darren Emerson. He liked what the pair had been cooking up and in short order, the three began knocking out tracks. The first fruits of this newly founded trio were released under the moniker of Lemon Interrupt.
