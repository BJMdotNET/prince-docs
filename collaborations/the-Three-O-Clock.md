From **"Acute jangle"** by **Rob Hughes** in the [April 2019 issue](https://recordcollectormag.com/issue-detail/491) of UK magazine [***Record Collector***](https://recordcollectormag.com/) (issue no. 491), page 75:

Months later, before The Bangles capped a dream year when **"Walk Like An Egyptian"** gave them their first US No 1, his Purpleness turned his attention to The Three O'Clock. "It might've been Sue Hoffs who said that Prince had seen our video of Her Head's Revolving and really liked it," explains Benair. "Then his LA office sent a woman to come see us play at the Palace. She really liked what she saw and reported back. Shortly after that, we signed to Paisley Park to record Vermillion [1988]. We also got a tour of Paisley Park, then afterwards there was a giant party, where Prince played until four in the morning. That was the only time that we met him. We kept getting threats that he was going to come to the studio, but he never did."
