   > The case starts off innocently enough, I suppose. The defendants somehow came to the conclusion that since they were involved in engineering some of Prince’s music before he died, they could release that music in early 2017 and no one would really mind. It turns out, of course, that Prince’s estate had some concerns.

    > A sound engineer has been ordered to pay Prince's estate nearly $4 million for releasing an unauthorized EP of songs by the late musician, it was ruled in Minnesota federal court on Monday (April 8).

    > **George Ian Boxill**, who released the Deliverance EP to streaming services in April 2017 in violation of a contract with the late singer, was ordered to pay the artist's estate $3.96 million in an arbitration ruling handed down in August 2018. The engineer had attempted to vacate the ruling by accusing the arbitrator of misconduct and of disregarding copyright law, but the judge in the Minnesota case said there was no basis for either of those claims.
