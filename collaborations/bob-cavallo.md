[Was “Kiss” the result of Bob Cavallo telling Prince that “Under the Cherry Moon” needed a hit song?](https://musicfans.stackexchange.com/q/8141/129)

The question:

> **Bob Cavallo** was part of Prince's management team from 1979 to ’89. According to [an interview with **Jon Bream**](http://www.startribune.com/prince-s-greatest-talent-self-confidence-says-the-manager-who-landed-purple-rain/508774052/) in the *Minneapolis Star Tribune*:
> 
> > Cavallo had to beg Prince to write a hit song for ***Under the Cherry
> > Moon***.
> > 
> > “When you said ‘Write a hit,’ he wrote a hit. This time it was
> > ‘Kiss.’ ”
> 
> Is this a true story? It seems unlikely that Prince would take orders from his management team in such a way.

The answer:

> **No.** Cavallo "misremembers".
> 
> In fact, the recording history of "Kiss" is well-documented and has been told numerous times. One of these stories can be read [on the **MusicThing** blog][1], and of particular interest is that page's November 2013 update at the bottom by Prince historian **Duane Tudahl**.
