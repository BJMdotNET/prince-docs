   > As the TDE rapper told Hot 97, they spent some time in Prince’s recording studio after the show, and Kendrick played “Complexion” for Prince with the hope that they could collaborate on the song.
   >
   > Unfortunately, they ran out of time before Prince could record any vocals. “Prince heard the record, loved the record, and the concept of the record got us to talking,” Kendrick revealed in an oral history published by the Recording Academy. “We got to a point where we were just talking in the studio and the more time that passed we realized we weren’t recording anything. We just ran out of time, it’s as simple as that.”
