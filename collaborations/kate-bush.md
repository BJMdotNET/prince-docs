 - From [**"Kate Bush discusses the material she recorded with Prince"**](https://www.nme.com/news/music/kate-bush-discusses-material-recorded-prince-1860552) by **Andrew Trendell** on 17 November 2016 in ***NME*** (***New Musical Express***):

    > Now, in [a rare interview with BBC 6 Music’s Matt Everitt](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/kate-bush-6-music-exclusive), she has again spoken of his genius. “He was adorable,” said Bush. “He was really playful and really sweet. What a talented man, what an artist. I think it’s a terrible loss that he should go at such a young age, its incredibly sad. He was so prolific, he used to make me laugh because whilst I was working on an album, he would have done 2 world tours, a couple of albums a film…”
    >
    > When asked if there was any unreleased material that hasn’t seen the light of day or hidden in her archive or Prince’s legendary ‘vault’, Bush denied that were any unheard songs.

    > And then, perhaps the pinnacle of these meetings. Kate Bush (another hero of mine) asked me to sing on Why Should I Love You?, a track for her new album The Red Shoes. She sent me a tape and I dutifully learnt my parts. When I arrived at the studio, I said: “It’s really weird but the guitar on this sounds so much like Prince – was that what you were going for?”
    > 
    > Kate said: “It sounds like Prince because it IS him. Do you wanna go in the booth?” I sang my heart out. I couldn’t believe it. I was performing on a song with two of my heroes.
